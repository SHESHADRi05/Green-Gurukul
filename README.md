Project: Trash to Treasure – A Gamified Learning App for Recycling & 
Sustainability 
Objective 
The goal of this project is to develop an interactive, game-based educational app that 
encourages students to recycle, reuse, and innovate using waste materials. Unlike traditional 
certificate-based learning platforms where students often skip content just to earn completion 
certificates, this app will focus on practical, hands-on learning. Teachers will have access to 
student progress and can assign marks based on participation and effort, making the learning 
process more impactful. 
Key Features 
1. Educational Modules on Waste Reuse & Upcycling 
o Students will learn how to creatively reuse waste products through 
interactive content. 
o Examples of upcycling ideas:  
▪ Soft drink cans → Pencil or toothbrush holders. 
▪ Plastic bottles → Vertical garden planters. 
▪ Old newspapers → Handmade paper or decorative items. 
▪ E-waste (old CDs, cables) → DIY home décor or educational projects. 
▪ Fabric waste (old clothes) → Reusable shopping bags or cushions. 
2. Gamified Practical Tasks 
o Students will receive hands-on recycling challenges, such as:  
▪ Creating useful products from waste and sharing their designs. 
▪ Completing sustainability challenges within their schools or 
communities. 
o Points and rewards will be given for creativity and effort. 
3. Awareness Campaign Challenges 
o Students will organize community awareness events on waste reduction 
and record their impact. 
o They can upload videos of their campaigns, workshops, or eco-friendly 
initiatives. 
o Teachers and peers can review and provide feedback. 
4. Teacher Dashboard for Tracking & Assessment 
o Educators will have admin access to track student participation and 
completed projects. 
o Teachers can assign grades or rewards based on student involvement. 
o A leaderboard can encourage friendly competition and engagement. 
Why This is Better than Certificate-Based Platforms 
• Many students skip video content on traditional e-learning platforms and earn 
certificates without gaining real knowledge. 
• This app ensures active participation by requiring students to complete real-world 
sustainability tasks rather than passive learning. 
• Impactful learning experience – Students apply what they learn in a creative and 
engaging way while contributing to environmental sustainability.
